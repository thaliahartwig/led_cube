  Description: This is a self-driven project to act as an introduction to microcontrollers, as well as
  physical computing. This project use the 4x4x4 led cube project created by KyleTheCreater on instructable 
  as a reference. The link to this reference can be found on my git page under the description for this 
  project. (https://www.instructables.com/4x4x4-LED-Cube-Arduino-Uno/)
  
  This project also serves as a the means to obtain skills in soldering for the creation of the cube which,
  I would have learnt throught University, had there been no restrictions put in place as a result of Covid-19.
